      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
      We are a group of friends and engineering peers whose diversity of experience, interest, and knowledge
      makes for engaging and lively discussion. This group is a way for
      us to continue these discussions as we move
      forward separately in our careers. The hope is to maintain fun
      social interactions but especially to continue stimulating and educating
      each other with periodic meetings. The focal point of these meetings is a
      presentation by a member deemed to be of interest to the group.

      <h3>Presentation Format</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Talk: slide deck suggested, other <b>organized and comprehensive</b>
          medium possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the general feel of the group is for engineering design,
          diversity in topics is encouraged, e.g. advanced academic work,
          business and industry perspective, contemporary geopolitical/economic
          assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Presentations that connect to tangible ideas, interesting intuition,
          and applicability in “real life" strongly encouraged.
        </li>
        <li>
          Presenter is expected to provide a one page summary of the presentation
          one week prior to the meeting. All audience members are expected to read
          this document before the meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          A one page summary of the presentation and subsequent discussion will be
          posted to this web site following each meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          For more details see the Presentation Instructions, Suggestions, and
          House Rules section below.

      <h3>House Rules</h3>
      <p>
      The most important feature of this group is enthusiasm and buy-in. But
      we must balance this with tradeoffs in time and energy that we all face.
      Consequently, we have chosen a 6-week meeting interval.
      A member will be required to present no more than two times in one year, and
      the requirements for audience members is to read the one page summary
      ahead of time, block out 90 minutes for the meeting every six weeks, and to
      show up ready to take part in a lively discussion. Having said that, it is
      <strong>incredibly important</strong> that members do take this degree of commitment (very
      low and diffuse over time) seriously to realize the benefits of this group.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Slide deck suggestions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No font smaller than 24 point.
        </li>
        <li>
          No more than 30 slides (i.e. 1 slide per minute).
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid more than 2 -- 3 big ideas per slide (less is more!).
        </li>
        <li>
          Figures and equations should be clear. Do not force too much on one slide.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Presenter responsibilities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be clear and do not rush through the slides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Responsible for moving forward after interjections and otherwise guiding the
          presentation dynamics (see below).
        </li>
        <li>
          Responsible for writing up one page summary of the presentation and discussion
          after the meeting.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Audience Member Responsibilities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Read the one page summary provided by the presenter before the meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not engage in other activities (e.g. reading email, etc.) during the
          presentation -- respect other members.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interjections during the presentation are allowed if 
              needed to clarify a point that is important for the talk, however 
              long tangents should be avoided until the discussion later.
              The presenter has the right to move on at their discretion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Group procedures</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Daniel and David will start off as the “editors” for the group.
          We will read and edit the one page background and one page
          review of the talks, to be posted on the site.  We will check
          our revisions with the author before posting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Membership in the group is currently by-invitation-only.  Please do not invite other members to the group without discussing with David and Daniel first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Can <strong>optionally</strong> provide slides for the website, however occasionally members of the group may
          present on confidential topics which may not be appropriate to post on the website.
