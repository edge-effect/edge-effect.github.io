      Edge effect is a collection of friends and engineering peers; we have
      previously worked together on various academic and business projects. We
      have found that our diversity of experiences, interests, and knowledge
      bases makes for engaging and lively discussion. This group is a way for
      us to continue these interactions in a productive way even as we move
      forward separately in our young careers. The hope is to maintain fun
      social interactions but especially to continue stimulating and educating
      each other with periodic meetings. The focal point of these meetings is a
      presentation by a member or members on any intellectual topic of
      potential utility to the group.

            The most important feature of this group is enthusiasm and buy-in. But
            we must balance this with tradeoffs in time and energy we all face.
            Consequently, we have chosen a 6-week meeting interval. This interval,
            along with the number of different presenters, should strike a good balance.
            A member will be required to present no more than 2 times in one year, and
            the requirements for audience members is simply to read the 1 page summary
            ahead of time, block out 1.5 hours for the meeting each 6 weeks, and to
            show up ready to take part in a lively discussion. Having said that, it is
            <b>incredibly important</b> that members do take this degree of commitment (very
            low and diffuse over time) seriously to realize the benefits of this group.<br>
            
            <b>Slide deck suggestions</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No font smaller than 24 point.
              </li>
              <li>
                No more than 30 slides (e.g. 1 slide per minute).
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid more than 2 -- 3 big ideas per slide (less is more!).
              </li>
              <li>
                Figures and equations should be clear. Do not force too much on one slide.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <b>Presenter responsibilities</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Be clear and do not rush through the slides.
              </li>
              <li>
                Responsible for moving forward, in a responsible manner, after interjections
                (see below).
              </li>
              <li>
                Responsible for writing up 1 page summary of the presentation and discussion
                after the meeting.

            <b>Audience Member Responsibilities</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Read the 1 page summary provided by the presenter before the meeting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not engage in other activities (e.g. reading email, etc.) during the
                presentation -- respect other members.
              </li>
              <li>
                Interjections during the presentation are allowed if:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    needed to clarify a point that is important for the talk.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    long tangents are avoided (discussion points can and should be
                    fleshed out more fully after the end of the presentation).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    presenter has the right to move on at their discretion.

                    review of the talks, to be posted on the site.  We will check
                    our revisions with the author before posting.
